Frontend for CS431 project BazaaRu

##### Please note that I haven't tested the following test too well! Please let me know if anything goes wrong. 

##### Getting started with the Typescript NodeJs example:

###### Step 1

Clone the repository to your local workspace. In the command line you can use:
> git clone https://github.com/tchopp/cs431_05_frontend.git

It may ask you to setup credentials for git. There are guides for this online, but feel free to reach out if you want help!

###### Step 2

cd into the repository cs431_05_frontend and then cd into typscript-nodejs. Then run the following:
> npx ts-node index.ts

The command line should print:
> The application is listening on port 3000!

###### Step 3

Open a web browser and go to:
> localhost:3000

The page should display a message for you!
After you're done, hit control+c in the command line to close the server.

Please let me know if this worked for you or if it gave you any errors!
